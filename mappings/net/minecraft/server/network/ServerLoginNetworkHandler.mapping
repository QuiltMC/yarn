CLASS net/minecraft/class_3248 net/minecraft/server/network/ServerLoginNetworkHandler
	COMMENT The server login network handler.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>It listens to packets on the netty event loop and is ticked on the
	COMMENT server thread simultaneously.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT @implSpec The vanilla implementation is created by a handshake network
	COMMENT handler. It first receives a hello packet from the client. If it's in
	COMMENT online mode, it goes through an additional authentication process. Then
	COMMENT it optionally sends a network compression packet next. Finally, when it
	COMMENT can accept the player (no player UUID conflicts), it will accept the
	COMMENT player by sending a login success packet and then transitions the
	COMMENT connection's packet listener to a server play network handler.
