		COMMENT Finds and returns the corresponding resource for a resource's identifier.
		COMMENT
		COMMENT <p>Starts by scanning each resource pack from highest priority to lowest. If no resource packs were found

		COMMENT
		COMMENT @throws java.io.FileNotFoundException if no matching resources could be found (i.e. if the list would be empty)
